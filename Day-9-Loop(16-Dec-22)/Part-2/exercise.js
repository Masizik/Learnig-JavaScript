Print out all even numbers between 1 and 100. Write two solutions: one with a while loop and one with a for loop.

# Exercise-5(Run loop and add $ in each repetition)-4

# Exercise-6(what will be the output and Let's explain) -3

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

function fizzBuzz(num){
//code
